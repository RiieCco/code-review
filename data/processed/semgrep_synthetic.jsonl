However, certain container images may contain `setuid` or `setgid` binaries that could allow an attacker to perform privilege escalation and gain access to sensitive resources. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to add a `securityContext` to the container in the pod, with the parameter `allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `false`. This will prevent the container from running any privileged processes and limit the impact of any potential attacks. By adding the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` parameter to your the `securityContext`, you can help to ensure that your containerized applications are more secure and less vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks.\nCWE: ['CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource']\nDetected Vulnerability Explanation: explain why this code is unsafe.\nHere is a corrected version:\n// Safe alternative for yaml"}

One potential vulnerability is when a container is allowed to run applications as the root user, which could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive resources. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to add a `securityContext` to the container, with the parameter `runAsNonRoot` set to `true`. This will ensure that the container runs as a non-root user, limiting the damage that could be caused by any potential attacks.

To avoid this potential vulnerability, it's recommended to use the  `memset_s()` function instead. `memset_s()` is a standardized function  that securely overwrites the memory with a specified value, making it more  difficult for an attacker to recover any sensitive data that was stored in  the buffer.
